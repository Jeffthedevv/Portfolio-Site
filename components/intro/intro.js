        <h4 className="welcoming">Bienvenidos!</h4>
        <p>I'm a developer & programmer currently based in Austin, TX. <br/>
        My expertise is JavsScript but picking up new languages or frameworks isn't a problem. <br />
        I have extensive knowledge in other languages. I am comfortable developing the frontend or backend as well as 
        refactoring code to new infrastructures. 
        </p>
        
        <p><span className="style_span">Overview</span> <br />As a fullstack developer it's hard to concatinate what I do on a
        day to day basis due to the variability,<br />but In the last year I have built 3 middleware applications, using Node. 
        On another front I am currently heading the development, <br />coordination, and porting to a popular weebsite to a Next JS stack.
        </p>

        <p>I read the anthology Beautiful Code, by Jon Bentley and it fundementally reaches the root of what I strive for as a programmer, developer, 
        or *Insert Title Here*<br />
          - In software, the most beautiful code, the most beautiful functions, and the most beautiful programs are sometimes not there at all.
